# api_template
This project was generated using fastapi_template.

## Poetry

This project uses poetry. It's a modern dependency management
tool.

To run the project use this set of commands:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python -m api_template
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

You can read more about poetry here: https://python-poetry.org/

## Docker

You can start the project with docker using this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

If you want to develop in docker with autoreload add `-f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml` to your docker command.
Like this:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml --project-directory . up
```

This command exposes the web application on port 8000, mounts current directory and enables autoreload.

But you have to rebuild image every time you modify `poetry.lock` or `pyproject.toml` with this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . build
```

## Migrations

If you want to migrate your database, you should run following commands:
```bash
# To run all migrations untill the migration with revision_id.
alembic upgrade "<revision_id>"

# To perform all pending migrations.
alembic upgrade "head"
```

### Reverting migrations

If you want to revert migrations, you should run:
```bash
# revert all migrations up to: revision_id.
alembic downgrade <revision_id>

# Revert everything.
 alembic downgrade base
```

### Migration generation

To generate migrations you should run:
```bash
# For automatic change detection.
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Migration name"

# For empty file generation.
alembic revision
```


## Running tests

If you want to run it in docker, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . run --rm api pytest -vv .
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . down
```

For running tests on your local machine.
1. you need to start a database.

I prefer doing it with docker:
```
docker run -p "5432:5432" -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=api_template" -e "POSTGRES_USER=api_template" -e "POSTGRES_DB=api_template" postgres:13.8-bullseye
```


2. Run the pytest.
```bash
pytest -vv .
```
